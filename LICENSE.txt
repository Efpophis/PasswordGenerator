This software is released under the terms of the WTFDBMPL public license,
Which I made up on the spot, heavily inspired by the WTFPL (http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl).

The license is ever-so-slightly more restrictive than the WTFPL, in that you
can't blame me if something bad happens (Section 1). 

Other than that, see Section 0.

The text of the license:
            
            
 DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO, JUST DON'T BLAME ME PUBLIC LICENSE
