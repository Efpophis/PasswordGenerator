This program is built with Netbeans IDE.

Its purpose is to generate a nice random password that's compliant with most corporate standards.

Alternatively, it can generate an arguably more secure passphrase, ie: horse correct battery staple

I wrote it because I got sick of having to come up with 10 random characters including 2 alphanumeric, 2 numbers,
2 special characters, etc.  Easier to code something up and push a button.

Install Instructions:
  Requires Java runtime environment. If your computer doesn't have that, though, there's gonna be a lot more
  than this that doesn't work.

  1. Grab the pwgen.jar file out of the "deploy" folder.
