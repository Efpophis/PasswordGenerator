This program is built with Netbeans IDE.

Its purpose is to generate a nice random password that's compliant with most corporate standards.

I wrote it because I got sick of having to come up with 10 random characters including 2 alphanumeric, 2 numbers,
2 special characters, etc.  Easier to code something up and push a button.

Coming soon:
  Generate secure passphrases, i/e: horse correct battery stapler
