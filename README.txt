This program is built with Netbeans IDE.

Its purpose is to generate a nice random password that's compliant with most corporate standards.

Alternatively, it can generate an arguably more secure passphrase, ie: horse correct battery staple

I wrote it because I got sick of having to come up with 10 random characters including 2 alphanumeric, 2 numbers,
2 special characters, etc.  Easier to code something up and push a button.

Developer Instructions:
  Import the project into NetBeans and build. You can then run it from the debugger, make changes, etc..
  It will produce a stand-alone JAR file as deploy/pwgen.jar

Standalone JAR:
  A standalone JAR is included in the repository. If you simply wish to use this program, just
    download and run deploy/pwgen.jar.
